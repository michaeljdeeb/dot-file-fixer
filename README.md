dot-file-fixer
==============

Utility to help fix Graphviz generated images when using a custom CSS with SchemaSpy.

This README is going to be pretty rough because it's been awhile since I've had to use this code, but the easiest way to run this code out of the box is to use a Mac due to the file separators and the location where `dot` is stored.

This utility works best when run from an IDE.
